## Local Setup

To generate the necessary TLS certificates, run the following command:

```bash
make keys
```

To start the proxy client, run:

```bash
make client
```

Make sure to configure your browser to use the proxy client. The client listens on `localhost:8080` and forwards the traffic to `localhost:8081` by default.

To start the proxy server, run:

```bash
make server
```

The server listens on `localhost:8081` by default.

### TLS Certificates

The proxy client and server use self-signed certificates for TLS. These certificates are generated using the `make keys` command and are stored in the `data/` directory.

## Installation

1. Update the `PRXY_SERVER` environment variable in the [prxy-client.service](systemd/prxy-client.service) to match the IP address of the server machine.
2. Update the `SERVER_SAN` in the [makefile](makefile) to match the `PRXY_SERVER`.
3. Generate the TLS certificates by running `make keys`.
4. Install the proxy server by running `make install-server` on the server machine.
5. Install the proxy client by running `make install-client` on the client machine.

## Uninstallation

1. Uninstall the proxy client by running `make uninstall-client` on the client machine.
2. Uninstall the proxy server by running `make uninstall-server` on the server machine.

## Configuration

The proxy client and server configurations are stored in the [prxy-client.service](systemd/prxy-client.service) and [prxy-server.service](systemd/prxy-server.service) files, respectively.

## Chrome Extension

For convenience, a Chrome extension is provided in the [extensions](extensions/) directory. To install the extension, follow these steps:

1. Open the Chrome browser and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable the `Developer mode` toggle.
3. Click on the `Load unpacked` button and select the `extensions/HTTPSProxyToggle` directory.

All this extension does is toggle the proxy settings in the browser to use the proxy client. The address of the proxy client is hardcoded to `127.0.0.1:8080`. If the proxy client is running on a different address, update the extension accordingly.

## Transparent mode (router)

The client also supports a transparent mode for Linux routers. In this mode, HTTPS connections coming from LAN clients are intercepted via iptables and forwarded through the mTLS tunnel to the remote server, without configuring proxies on endpoints.

- Run the client with `--transparent` and listen on an unprivileged port, e.g. `0.0.0.0:8080`.
- Add NAT rules to redirect TCP/443 to the client and allow INPUT on tcp/8080 from LAN.

See `tprxy_example.sh` for a minimal end-to-end setup script that:

- Creates a `PRXY` chain in the `nat` table
- Excludes the proxy server itself and localhost to avoid loops
- Redirects TCP/443 to port 8080
- Hooks `PREROUTING` on `br-lan` and `OUTPUT` for routerâ€™s own traffic
- Starts the client in a simple restart loop
